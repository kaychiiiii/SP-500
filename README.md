# S&P 500 Web App
My first Streamlit web app of the S&P 500 stock closing prices, adapted from https://github.com/dataprofessor/streamlit_freecodecamp/blob/main/app_5_eda_sp500_stock/sp500-app.py.

This app retrieves the list of the **S&P 500** (from Wikipedia) and their corresponding **stock closing prices** (using the Python library `yfinance`).
* Data source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies)
* Libraries: `streamlit`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `base64`, `yfinance`

## Additional References:

## To Run:
```
streamlit run main.py
```
